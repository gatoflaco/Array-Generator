## Overview
The purpose of this program is to generate test suites of enumerated 2-dimensional arrays with the covering, locating, and detecting properties.

### I have just recently gotten this to a reasonably sufficient level of functionality. While the code can generate decently optimal covering, locating, and detecting arrays with high consistency, I have not had the chance to optimize the code or even test it all that much. Please be patient while I continue to work this project to a higher level of quality.
Also, I have been too lazy to write the readme hehe. I will have all the details written out soon, hopefully within the next few weeks!
