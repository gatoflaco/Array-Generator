|===========================================================================================================|
|   This header contains classes for managing the array in an automated fashion. The Interaction and T      |
| classes are used to represent fundamental covering/locating/detecting array concepts that guide scoring   |
| decisions during array generation. They are used only by the Array class and should not be instantiated   |
| by any source file other than the one associated with this header. The Array class is the interface with  |
| which other source files should work. It contains a constructor that builds all the internal data         |
| structures, thereby allowing the instantiator to immediately call other methods which carry out random    |
| row generation based on this data. See check.cpp for an example.                                          |
